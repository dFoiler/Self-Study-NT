\section{Introduction}
This document contains a record of my solutions to some of the exercises from Apostol's \href{http://dl.icdst.org/pdfs/files1/8dc80d73b142455012b6c7d87a2e3a0b.pdf}{\textit{Introduction to Analytic Number Theory}}. I start in chapter 2 because that's where the nonelementary mathematics begins to appear, and I try to cover as many exercises as I can stomach.
